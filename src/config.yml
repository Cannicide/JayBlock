  # {nl} = New line in the message (usable multiple times).
  nonexist: "&3Unknown command. Type &b/help&3 for help."

# Whether or not to use a custom "command does not exist" message. The message can be customized in the above section.
# If "allow-unregistered" is set to true, this option is automatically disabled.
nonexist-enabled: true

# Whether or not to allow blocking of unregistered and non-plugin commands.
# If set to false, unregistered/vanilla/bukkit commands will not be scanned by JayBlock.
# If set to false, all minecraft/bukkit commands can only be used with prefixes (ex: "minecraft:give" or "bukkit:pl")
# If set to true, the "nonexist-enabled" feature will be indirectly disabled.
allow-unregistered: false

# If set to false, worldedit commands are treated like nonexistent commands and are blocked by nonexist.
# If set to true, nonexist will not block WE commands. However, it will not override the "unknown command" message for WE.
worldedit-exists: true

# Blocked commands and prefixes without the initial slash. All registered aliases of blocked commands will also be blocked.
# Supports commands (ex: "plugins")
# Supports prefixes (ex: "minecraft:")
# Supports specific command arguments (ex: "give @p" - prevents giving items to the closest player, but allows giving to any other selector)

  - pl
  - 'minecraft:'
